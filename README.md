## 📋 Project Overview

"Merchant Tales" is a business simulation game set in a classic fantasy world. Players inherit a small tool shop from their retired grandfather and learn fundamental investment concepts naturally through buying and selling goods.

### 🎯 Concept

- **Experience the essence of investing through commerce without using the term "stock trading"**
- **Main target: 15-25 year olds with no investment experience**
- **Casual and approachable gaming experience**

## 🎮 Key Features

### Item System

Six different item types each representing different investment concepts:

| Item | Characteristics | Investment Concept |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 🍎 Fruit | Spoils quickly | Short-term trading |
| 🧪 Potion | Event-driven price changes | Growth stocks |
| ⚔️ Weapon | Stable prices, low turnover | Blue-chip stocks |
| 💍 Accessory | Trend-driven price volatility | Speculative stocks |
| 📚 Magic Book | High-value, stable | Bonds |
| 💎 Gem | Unpredictable, high returns | High-risk investment |

### Game Systems

- **Progressive growth**: 4 stages from Apprentice → Skilled → Veteran → Master
